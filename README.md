# Slice

A fast and easy collaboration cropping tool

## Introduction

Slice is a tool made with the intention of making it easy to make crops for social media profile picture collaboration.
There are tools out there that make it easy for singular profile pictures, but this project intends to make it easier in
cases of two or more profiles.

## Motivation

As for personal reasons, this is my first ReactJS project. Due to that the code might be absolutely atrocious. Help is 
also welcome!

## Getting started

### Installing dependencies

`npm install`

### Usage

`npm start`

## Preview

The image below showcases a visual update, it will still work the same as the preview above. I have just been too lazy to make another gif of it.
