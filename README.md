## Introduction

Slice is a tool made with the intention of making it easy to make crops for social media profile picture collaboration.
There are tools out there that make it easy for singular profile pictures, but this project intends to make it easier in
cases of two or more profiles. The intended purpose for the cropped images are profile pictures, and because of that,
it will only allow square crops.

## Features
